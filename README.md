## Overview
NeuroPathX fuses MRI-derived brain features with pathway-aggregated genetic signals via pathway-guided cross-attention. Paired sparsity and pathway-similarity losses stabilize interpretation of regionâ€“pathway interactions, enabling robust biological insight even in small-sample settings.
